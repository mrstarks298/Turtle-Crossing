## Description 
Turtle Crossing is a simple arcade-style game implemented in Python using the Turtle graphics library. The player controls a turtle that must cross a busy highway while avoiding cars. As the player progresses, the difficulty increases with faster-moving cars. The game features a cool typing effect in its header display.

## Features
- Player-controlled turtle that moves upward
- Randomly generated cars moving from right to left
- Increasing difficulty as the player advances levels
- Score tracking and display
- Game over condition when the turtle collides with a car
- Typing effect in the game's header

## How to Play
1. Run the main game script.
2. Use the Up arrow key to move the turtle forward.
3. Avoid colliding with cars while trying to reach the top of the screen.
4. Each successful crossing increases your level and the game's difficulty.
5. The game ends if your turtle collides with a car.

## Files
- `main.py`: The main game loop and setup
- `player.py`: Defines the Player class for the turtle character
- `car_manager.py`: Manages the creation and movement of cars

## Future Improvements
- Add sound effects
- Implement a high score system
- Create power-ups or obstacles
- Add different levels or themes
